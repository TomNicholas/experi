Examples
--------

This is a collection of examples files demonstrating how to use the experiment.yml file.
The examples should be run and experimented with.


The `simple.yml` file is a very simple example which will `echo`
the variables in combinations to the screen.
The intention is that you play with this to understand how
the combinations of the variables works.


The `demo.yml` file is the file that we end up with at the end of the [input file tutorial][experiment docs].
It used some of the more complicated logic that is available.

The `pbs.yml` file demonstrates setting up a file for submission to a batch scheduler.
As long as there is no batch scheduler the submission files are generated
so this can be tested on a regular machine before trying it out on a cluster.

The `crystal_liquid_interface.yml` file is a file that I am using in my research
demonstrating man of the capabilities of the specification.
It demonstrates the complexity of the file specification that is available.
